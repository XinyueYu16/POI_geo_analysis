Still in the process of half-automation, where

- You have to make sure the mitmproxy is on
- You have to manually slide for Meituan Authentification
- If you are detected abnormal, execution needs to be restarted manually

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fix in progress:

- If Meituan Authentification Slide shows up, hold the driver still, using While True
- Wrap the codes in .py?

_____________________

No intention for automatic sliding right now
